/**
 * Dynamic programming implementation of a Plackett-Luce inspired finite-state machine.
 * 
 * @param weights 		a list of weights,
 * @param base_rate 	the base rate for an event to success,
 * @param qmax 			the max amount of time the event can success before halting. 
 * The probability for the event to happen is individually proportional to the weight.
 * E.g. if weights = [400, 100, 100], then each individual success rate is equal to
 * base_rate * [400, 100, 100] / 100 = [4, 1, 1].
 * 
 * This FSM models the probabilities for each `weight` in weights to succeed the event if the order
 * for rolling the event is picked following the Plackett-Luce distribution, i.e. by sampling a random permutation
 * one by one where each position is picked proportionnally to the remaining weights.
 * 
 * States (`R`, `k`) 
 * 		Each state reprensents the probability mass that we have `R` remaining players and `k` success.
 * 		`R`: remaining players, in form of a bitmask (set bit = weight at that index remaining to roll).
 * 		`k`: how many success have already happened (`0<=k<=qmax`).
 * 
 * Transitions
 * 		For each state `S(R, k)`, for each `weight` in `R`, `weight` is selected with probability `weight / sum(R)`, 
 * 		then `S` can transition to any state:
 * 			- `S_next(R\weight, k+1)` with probability `p_weight`, or  
 * 			- `S_next(R\weight, k)` with probability `1-p_weight`
 * 		where `p_w` is the individual probability for weight `weight` to success the event. 
 * 
 * Halting 
 * 		We stop when either `k == qmax` or `R` is empty.
 * 
 * The aim of this function is to accumulate the probabilities for each individual `weight` as well as for
 * each value of `k` to succeed, by simulating the construction of this FSM, mimicking the Placett-Luce model
 * and adapting it to track the remaining weights instead of all the permutations.
 * 
 * @returns [w_res, q_res] 	where 
 * 							- `w_res` is the accumulated probabilities for each `weight` to succeed, and
 * 							- `q_res` is the accumulated probabilities for each amount `0<=q<=qmax` of success.
